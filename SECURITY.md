# Security Policy üîí

This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for the My Awesome Weather App project.  Security is a top priority, and we are committed to protecting user data and ensuring the integrity of the application.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities üö®

If you discover a security vulnerability in the application, please report it responsibly by emailing [your email address or security contact].  Please provide as much detail as possible, including:

* **Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.**
* **Expected behavior vs. actual behavior.**
* **Any relevant code snippets or screenshots.**
* **Your contact information (optional).**

We will investigate all reported vulnerabilities promptly and take appropriate action to address them.

## Security Measures Implemented üõ°Ô∏è

* **Input Validation:** All user inputs are validated on both the front-end and back-end to prevent common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL injection.
* **Secure Authentication:** User authentication is implemented using Firebase Authentication, providing secure password management and account protection.
* **HTTPS Enforcement:**  All communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.
* **API Rate Limiting:** Rate limiting is implemented on the backend API to protect against abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Regular Dependency Updates:**  Dependencies are updated regularly to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Code Reviews:** All code changes undergo review to identify and address potential security issues before deployment.

## Data Protection üóÑÔ∏è

* **Data Minimization:** The application collects only the minimal amount of user data required for functionality.
* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive user data (e.g., location, preferences) is stored securely using appropriate encryption methods.
* **Access Control:** Access to user data is restricted to authorized personnel and services.
* **Data Retention Policy:**  A clear data retention policy is in place to govern how long user data is stored and how it is disposed of.

## Security Best Practices üõ†Ô∏è

* **Secure Coding Guidelines:**  Developers follow secure coding guidelines to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Periodic security audits are conducted to assess the application's security posture and identify areas for improvement.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Professional penetration testing is performed to simulate real-world attacks and uncover vulnerabilities.

## Future Security Enhancements ‚è≥

* **Two-Factor Authentication:** Implement two-factor authentication to provide an additional layer of account security.
* **Automated Security Scanning:** Integrate automated security scanning tools into the development pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early.


We are continually working to improve the security of our application.  This document will be updated as new security measures are implemented.  Thank you for your help in keeping our application secure!
